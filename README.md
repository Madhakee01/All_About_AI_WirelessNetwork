# All_About_AI_WirelessNetwork
Learning more about wireless networks, and about existing research in AI enabled wireless networks. I don't know but for some reasons my interests started  shifting to Wireless Networks and the use of AI in it... pretty cool stuff on the outside. It's like a paradigm shift to my educational interests.  So i am making this learning repo to cummulate resources to learn in-depth. 

Learning Resources:

Step 0: Need to brush up my knowledge on Wireless Networks... gonna read the good old Book "Computer Networking - A Top-Down Approach" 7th Edition - Chapter 7 that covers wireless, mobile networking WiFi networks and cellular networks inclusing 4g and LTE... and watch several open-sourced lecture videos. 

1. First step... even though i know nothing about AI in 5g, wireless networks or anything in telecommunications. I will start off by reading Dr. Melike Erol-Kantarci Research Papers available online and write summaries on them. From this I will take out the important topic and google about them to learn more. 

2. Second Step... Dr. Melike said that Desingning Algorithms is so important in Research, so i need to start improving my Designing and Algorithmns and Analysis skills. Look into existing AI Wireless Networks algorithms and try re-implementing them.
