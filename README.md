# All_About_AI_WirelessNetwork
Learning more about wireless networks, and about existing research in AI enabled wireless networks. I don't know but for some reasons my interests started  shifting to Wireless Networks and the use of AI in it... pretty cool stuff on the outside. It's like a paradigm shift to my educational interests. In colloboration with Mohammad Chegini, an electrical engineer student from Shahid Beheshti University, Iran, we will be sharing a curated collection of resources to learn AI, Telecommunications and Wireless Networks. 


Learning Areas: 

1. AI Basics
2. ML Algorithms
3. Computer Networks
4. Wireleess Networks
5. Telecomminications


For each of these learning areas, we will post a series of summarized research papers from TOP AI Enabled Computer Networks, 5g, 6g researchers in the world.
