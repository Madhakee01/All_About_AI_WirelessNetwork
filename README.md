# All_About_AI_WirelessNetwork
Learning more about wireless networks, and about existing research in AI enabled wireless networks. I don't know but for some reasons my interests started  shifting to Wireless Networks and the use of AI in it... pretty cool stuff on the outside. It's like a paradigm shift to my educational interests. In colloboration with Mohammad Chegini, an electrical engineer student from Shahid Beheshti University, Iran, we will be sharing a curated collection of resources to learn AI, Telecommunications and Wireless Networks. Mohammad is also very much interested in this fiels, and wants to explore. We hope that these list of resources will be useful for other students like us. 


Learning Areas: 

1. AI Basics
2. ML Algorithms
3. Computer Networks
4. Wireleess Networks
5. Telecomminications


For each of these learning areas, we will post a series of summarized research papers from TOP AI Enabled Computer Networks, 5g, 6g researchers in the world.

After we get a clear understanding of AI Enabled Computer Networks, we will build a roadmap for you to learn from beginning level.
